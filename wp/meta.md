abstract: This paper covers the economics of the Akash Network and introduces the Akash Token (AKT). In this paper, we present various incentives for ensuring the economic security of the Akash ecosystem as well as drive adoption. We propose an inflationary mechanism to achieve economic goals along with estimates for mining rewards and inflation rates. Additionally, we also present mechanisms for allowing a multitude of fee tokens, which will improve the user experience of using the blockchain.
