# Overview

## Getting Started

The guides below walk you through installing and using all components of Akash software. The entire system is quite large, and different pieces serve different users, so we've broken it up as much as possible.

### Variables

Shell variables will be used throughout these guides to make the instructions so that the commands can be used verbatim.

The beginning of each guide will give a list of variables used and how to populate them.

Because of this, it is important to type the commands into a terminal that the variables have been defined in - changing terminals will mean that you have to re-define the variable.
