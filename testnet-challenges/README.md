# Testnet Challenges

The Akashian Challenge Testnet 3 will test and showcase Akash's deployment platform; users will be incentivized to deploy applications using the Akash network.  Lasting two weeks, Testnet 3 will include guided challenges for deploying apps of increasing complexity — from simple single-page applications to blockchain network components — and open-ended challenges where users can show off their Akash OPS skills by extending the guided examples to deploy any application they wish - from DeFi to CI.

There are additional rewards for participation outside of the deployment challenges.  These challenges include contributions such as active validator participation, writing blog posts and how-to guides, and sharing novel uses of the Akash platform.

The testnet will run on the **`edgenet`** network.  See [Choosing a Network](/guides/version.md) for
