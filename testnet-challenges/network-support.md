Follow the [node guides](guides/node/README.md) to install and configure
your node to run on the current **edgenet** network.

When your node is ready, make a pull request on [ovrclk/net](https://github.com/ovrclk/net) that
adds your host to the appropriate registries (see below for details)

You will receive points for hosting each of the following:

## Validator

## RPC Node

Host an RPC node and add its connection details to `edgenet/rpc-nodes.txt`

## API Node
